TRUTH-SEEKING DIVESTMENT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
============================================

GUIDING PRINCIPLES:
• Scientific integrity over confirmation bias
• Show all results, including negative outcomes
• Apply rigorous statistical testing
• Include realistic costs and constraints
• Document all assumptions and limitations

DATA SOURCES:
• Price data: Sharadar equity database
• Exclusions: Comprehensive ESG exclusions database
• Period: 2010-2024 (maximum available history)
• Universe: US domestic equities

SURVIVORSHIP BIAS:
• Dataset includes delisted securities where available
• Bias impact documented in analysis
• Results interpreted with appropriate caution

PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION:
• Equal-weighted portfolios (academic standard)
• Monthly rebalancing (realistic for institutions)
• No optimization for favorable results
• Minimum universe size: 20 securities

COST ASSUMPTIONS:
• Transaction costs: 10 bps per rebalance
• Management fees: 25 bps annually
• No performance fees
• Based on institutional implementation reality

BENCHMARK CONSTRUCTION:
• Equal-weighted universe without exclusions
• Same cost assumptions as test portfolios
• Same rebalancing frequency
• Fair comparison methodology

STATISTICAL TESTING:
• Primary metric: Excess return vs benchmark
• Test statistic: One-sample t-test vs zero
• Multiple testing: Holm correction method
• Confidence intervals: Bootstrap (1000 iterations)
• Significance level: 5% (two-tailed)

SCENARIOS TESTED:
• No cherry-picking of exclusion combinations
• All major ESG categories included
• Realistic exclusion percentages based on market data
• Combined scenarios based on common institutional approaches

TIME PERIODS TESTED:
• Multiple non-overlapping periods
• Include bull and bear markets
• Pre- and post-COVID periods
• No selection bias for favorable periods

LIMITATIONS:
• Historical analysis may not predict future performance
• Transaction cost estimates may not capture all costs
• Exclusions database may have coverage limitations
• Results sensitive to implementation methodology
• Multiple testing corrections may be conservative

TRANSPARENCY COMMITMENTS:
• All results published (positive and negative)
• Complete methodology documentation
• Raw data export for verification
• Statistical code available upon request
• No selective reporting of favorable outcomes

This methodology prioritizes scientific integrity and truth-seeking
over marketing objectives.
